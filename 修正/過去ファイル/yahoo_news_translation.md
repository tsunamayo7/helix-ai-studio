### Translated Text

Internal conflicts have come to the surface within the Center-Reform Coalition following its devastating defeat in the House of Representatives election. Lawmakers from the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) have suggested their intention to exclude Komeito-affiliated members from the leadership race, stating "we won't nominate anyone from Komeito."

According to the article, elected representatives gathered at the CDP headquarters on the evening of the 10th, with a "private meeting" scheduled before the party members' general assembly the following day. The situation within the party is described as so severe that members are using the expression "it's a scorched wasteland."

The article also points out that the merger at the House of Councillors and local levels is showing "warning signs." Regarding the new leadership selection, harsh assessments are being made, with sources noting it's "far worse than picking up hot chestnuts from the fire."
