# X (Twitter) English Posts -- Helix AI Studio

5 variations targeting global developer/AI community. Each under 280 characters.

## Post 1: Pipeline Focus

```
Claude plans. Local Ollama models execute. Claude validates.

I built an open-source desktop app that orchestrates cloud + local AI in a 3-phase pipeline. Phase 2 is 100% local -- zero API cost, full privacy.

## Post 2: Problem/Solution Focus

```
Tired of juggling Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Ollama in separate windows?

Helix AI Studio: one app where multiple AIs work together automatically. Cloud AI plans, local LLMs execute, cloud AI validates. GUI -- no code required.

Free, MIT licensed.

## Post 3: Cost Focus

```
What if 80% of your AI workload ran free on your own GPU?

Helix AI Studio: Claude handles planning + validation (2 API calls). Ollama handles execution locally (free). Your GPU does the heavy lifting.

Open source, MIT.

## Post 4: Privacy + Technical Focus

```
Multi-AI orchestration with privacy:

Phase 1: Claude designs (cloud)
Phase 2: Ollama executes (100% local)
Phase 3: Claude validates (cloud)

Sensitive data stays on your machine. PyQt6 desktop + React Web UI.

## Posting Notes

- Best posting times: 8-10 AM PT (weekday mornings US) for maximum developer reach
- X counts URLs as 23 characters regardless of actual length (t.co wrapping)
- Attach a screenshot or demo GIF to each post -- visual posts get significantly more engagement
- Consider a thread strategy: Post 1 as standalone, then over the following days post 2-5 at different times
- Suggested accounts to tag (use sparingly): @AnthropicAI, @ollaboratory, @OpenAI
- Hashtag strategy: use 3-4 max per post. Mix broad (#AI #OpenSource) with specific (#Ollama #LocalLLM)
- Do not post all 5 on the same day -- space them out over 1-2 weeks
- Monitor replies and engage quickly -- early engagement boosts visibility
